## 📊 Using Your Own Data

### CSV Requirements
- Header row with column names
- At least 10 rows
- At least 2 columns
- One column as target (what you want to predict)

### Example Structure
```csv
feature1,feature2,feature3,target
1.2,5.4,cat,yes
2.3,6.1,dog,no
```

## 🔧 Common Issues & Fixes

### "Python not found"
**Fix**: Install Python 3.8+ from python.org

### "Module not found"
**Fix**: 
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate environment first
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Port 5000 in use"
**Fix**: 
```bash
# Kill process on port 5000
lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9  # macOS/Linux
```

### Upload fails
**Fix**: Ensure CSV is properly formatted with headers

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### For Accuracy
- Use clean, preprocessed data
- Try multiple models with Auto-Optimize
- Ensure balanced class distribution

### For Speed
- Start with simpler models (Logistic Regression)
- Use Random Search instead of Grid Search
- Smaller datasets train faster

### For Learning
- Start with sample_data.csv
- Try different hyperparameters manually
- Compare auto-optimized vs manual results

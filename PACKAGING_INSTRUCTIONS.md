## Testing Before Distribution

1. **Extract ZIP to Test Directory**
   ```bash
   unzip ml-comparison-platform.zip
   cd ml-comparison-platform
   ```

2. **Run Setup Script**
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   bash setup.sh
   
   # Windows
   setup.bat
   ```

3. **Test Application**
   ```bash
   # Activate virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   
   # Run application
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Test in Browser**
   - Open http://localhost:5000
   - Upload sample_data.csv
   - Train a model manually
   - Run auto-optimization
   - Check results display

5. **Test Error Handling**
   - Try uploading non-CSV file
   - Try training without dataset
   - Try auto-optimize without target selection
   - Verify error messages display correctly
